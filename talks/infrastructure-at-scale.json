    "description": "This is a technical architect's case study of how Loggly has employed the latest social-media-scale technologies as the backbone ingestion processing for our multi-tenant, geo-distributed, and real-time log management system. This presentation describes design details of how we built a second-generation system fully leveraging AWS services including Amazon Route 53 DNS with heartbeat and latency-based routing, multi-region VPCs, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Relational Database Service, and a number of pro-active and re-active approaches to scaling computational and indexing capacity.",
