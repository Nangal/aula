    "description": "A lot of my talks like 'How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub' and posts like 'How GitHub Works' are nifty, but they represent a snapshot of the company when we were 30-75 employees. We're 217 today, and things inevitably changed to grow the company to that scale. This talk is a retrospective: it takes a closer look at specific things that we've said over the last few years, and then details the adjustments that were made as we've grown.",
