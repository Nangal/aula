    "description": "GIFs are important, or everyone knows that Web Components are the future, right? Or maybe you think that a well-written Angular directive has everything you need. Or, perhaps, you think that there’s no such thing as a well-written Angular directive and so you’ll stick with your Ember components thank-you-very-much. Then again, once your brain is thinking in React, why would you use anything else? This talk is about the reality of component-based web development, told through the frivolous pursuit of a more awesome IMG tag for animated GIFs. It’s a not-so-serious window into a terribly important debate about better encapsulation, reuse, and happiness in our front-end lives.",
