    "description": "After several years of being a professional programmer, I realized that I didn't really know what I was doing, and decided to teach myself Computer Science. After spending a year learning Computer Science from the ground up, I thought I was starting to understand things. Then I came across Haskell. It fascinated and frustrated me, and I wanted to understand how types worked. I also began wondering - why doesn't Ruby have a modern type system? Do we need one? Do we want one? How would it work?",
