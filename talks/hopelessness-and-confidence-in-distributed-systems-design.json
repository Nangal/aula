    "description": "When designing real-world distributed applications, we face many decision points. Understanding the tradeoffs that we face at these decision points lets us make smarter choices faster. This talk will discuss a series of real-world distributed applications built by the speaker and some of the key tradeoffs that were made in these systems. This is a pragmatic talk for an audience who is eager to go beyond hope and fear into the lightness of hopelessness and confidence.",
