    "description": "\"TDD as One True Way\" versus \"TDD as devil-spawned tempter\" is not a productive contrast. Most of us have similar goals for development: confidence, impact, challenge, belonging. Test-driven development is one path toward these goals, but there are many other paths. This conversation in six parts explores tradeoffs in development, places TDD in those tradeoffs, and gives you perspective with which you can decide for yourself how you want to program.",
