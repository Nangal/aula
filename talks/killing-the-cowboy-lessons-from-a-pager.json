    "description": "A smörgåsbord of stories of things done while keeping websites up, and how to learn more, faster. A walk-through of some great/horrible solutions to problems in production and a discussion of the lessons learned, the lessons that shouldn't have been learned, and the real lessons that took a little while longer to learn. With a probable inclusion of a small lecture on his caremad for cowboy engineers.",
