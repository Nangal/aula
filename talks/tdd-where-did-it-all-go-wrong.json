    "description": "Since Kent Beck wrote the book on TDD in 2002 a lot of words have been dedicated to the subject.  In this talk we re-discover Kent's original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occured and look at a better approach to TDD that supports sofware development instead of impeding it. Be prepared from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written.",
