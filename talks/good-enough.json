    "description": "As a programmer, work-life balance has always been a tricky thing for me. Steve Wozniak commented that “you can’t stop the steamroller of technology change.” That notion has been applied to software. If you rest you risk being squished. I don’t really know what it means to be \"good enough\" yet, but this talk will explore those lines between work/life balance and how we keep our edge on the job while being present in the moments off the job.",
